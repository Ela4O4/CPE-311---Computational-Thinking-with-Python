To execute this, the solution is to first convert list b into a set, which makes it faster to check if something is inside it. Then, it goes through each item in list a and keeps only the ones that are not in b. This way, every occurrence of values from b is removed from a. The function then returns the new list. The test cases will check different situations, like removing one value, handling repeated numbers, working with empty lists, and removing more than one value at a time. Since all the tests pass, the solution works correctly and runs effectively. "
